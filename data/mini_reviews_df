They are very friendly, accommodating, and fun to talk with. The room was peaceful, clean and had a comfortable bed. We were provided with water that was refilled constantly and if you forgot some of your toiletries, there were extras provided in the cubby (best yet, the soap and shampoo are non-toxic! How awesome is that?!). We were greeted with hot coffee, fresh fruit and tasty organic lollipops every morning. Ann and Lee also gave really good recommendations for everything around the area (restaurants, shopping, coffee, and sight seeing) 

Their location is extremely convenient. We were able to walk around the corner to our new favorite coffee shop in Portland (the double decker bus - Tov), shop on Hawthorne, and eat our Blue Star donuts. Safeway and a fruit market is a couple blocks down the street as well.

Joel greeted us on arrival and showed us to the apartment and even carried might wife's lugage up to the apartment. Although we had a rental car, the apartment is really close to bus lines and the yellow MAX line that we took public transportation to go everywhere (downtown, Portland Zoo, Old Town...).  Peninsula Park, New Seasons Market and access to  I-5 are also really close to the apartment.  I think I could go on and on but what I want to say is that this is a really really nice place to stay.

It's perfectly suited for a group of six girls, with two to a bed if you're all comfortable with one another. The bedrooms connect through an adjacent door and Emilie has a bunch of earrings on display that girls can borrow -- even though I don't have pierced ears myself, I really enjoyed that feature and thought it added character and friendliness to an already very beautiful and eclectic house! 

In my specific case I was travelling with two boys and so it was nice for me to have my own room, and for the boys to each have their own beds that were bunked in the other bedroom. The piano by the front door was beautiful, and Emilie has a bunch of umbrellas by the front door that you are free to use -- perfect for Portland. Emilie is a very generous hostess!

Emilie's communication style as a hostess is very hands off, but she is good about responding to you when you check in and check out. I personally would have liked a little more communication in between, but everyone is different that way. In the end, we had lots of space to ourselves and slept soundly on the beds, which are very comfortable. The water temperature in the shower was great as well! While we didn't use the kitchen to cook, we made use of the fridge and sinks and all were in excellent working condition.  Emilie had some stocked beers in the fridge... again, we were free to use them. 

Quick note on transportation: Emilie's neighborhood is safe (right next to an elementary school). We always felt well-connected to the rest of Portland, with buses running frequently into town.

First, the accommodations. The entire upstairs is yours to call home, and what a nice little home it is. Full bathroom, a nice bed with TV setup, and your own AC unit. Their backyard patio is excellent to just relax, read a book, have a night cap, etc. My girlfriend and I felt right at home here.

Last, but not least, the hosts. Diane, Rodger and Mr. B (their wonderful pup!) were amazing hosts. They are incredibly welcoming, friendly and just down to earth good people. I would say that they went out of their way to make our stay even more pleasant, but I am pretty sure that is just the type of people they are. I could ramble on ad nauseam about how great these three made our stay, but you get the point.

This newly built-out subterranean apartment is tucked away under the main residence with a private entry in a quiet, safe, neighborhood conveniently located to other great Portland areas as well as easy access to the freeway. The parking was simple and free- right out front in the quiet neighborhood. Marianne and her husband Rich were extremely accommodating with good tips for my time there and quick communication all around. 
I loved the apartment and enjoyed my stay there because of the custom design/layout and the airy and bright feeling. In fact, it didn't feel like a basement at all! It was immaculately clean, with free wifi, and great cell service. The kitchen, linens, and furniture all are new and well chosen for a cohesive design sense that is modern yet cozy (nice art pieces on the walls and beautiful house plants). Marianne and Rich have an eye for quality in their home and their hosting style. I really got the sense that they take pride in their home and AirBnB rental. The cozy, open apartment edges towards luxury because the spacious layout, privacy, the new furnishings, linens and bed are so comfortable and well considered. 
The kitchen had everything I needed for cooking including an interesting coffee maker with a built in coffee bean grinder. I absolutely loved the shower- very cool tile and the oversized rain-shower head was amazing!
They live above, in the main house and although I could hear their soft footsteps from time to time, they and their daughter Fiona were very quiet and non disruptive.
Many of the rentals in the neighborhood look similar online but Marianne's place is outstanding because of the privacy, spaciousness, quality and newness. I was surprised that the bedroom and living room were so large- I had plenty of room for yoga and although I stayed there alone, it would easily accommodate multiple people.
I highly recommend Marianne's place and will defiantly stay there again when I am in Portland. Thank you Marianne and Rich!

It was also my first trip to Portland, and our stay at Julie & David's was perfect for what we wanted to do. There are tons of great little restaurants within 1-5 min walking distance, even more within 10 min. We specifically came to Portland for the breweries and never had to walk more than 15-20min to get to each one on our list. It's in a stellar location. The house itself was amazing. Super clean and very welcoming--when we arrived there was an adorable little sign welcoming us. The keyless entry was a breeze and we felt like we had ample space to ourselves. The bed was extremely comfortable and the little sitting room next to it was perfect to relax with a coffee in. They left us some delicious scones each morning. We rarely saw them or heard them (never an inconvenience). The few times we did see them, they were very nice and Julie was happy to recommend places. I am allergic to cats and had zero issues while staying here. Thank you Julie & David! We'd definitely stay here again!

The bed was really comfortable, the kitchen reasonably well stocked if you wish to cook there. (Lots of food storage containers, cooking utensils, pots and pans etc. Oil and pepper but no salt. No paper towels but I think that’s an anomaly.) 

It was pretty clean, but there was a surprise from a former guest - pot ashes in the bottom plate in the cupboard. We just washed things before using them to be safe. When we were there the tub was not draining properly, and I think that made the shower curtain smelly. Adama was going to address this with maintenance for future guests.

This was the fastest and most reliable wifi that I've seen in any rental.
Some things to note: the room is pretty small. This was fine for us as we only had a carryon bag between us, but if you have more luggage than that, you will be stepping over it. Also, the shower is incredibly small; heavyset folks will find it uncomfortably so and shaving legs requires some creative postures. While we had absolutely no problems with parking, parking IS on the street.  Finally, if you have trouble sleeping without near- complete darkness, I recommend bringing a sleep mask.

358,53536,2015435,39919684,2015-07-27,31805088,Sacha,"If you have young children and want the best place to stay in the city of Portland, OR - this is your spot!  We traveled with 2 toddlers and our stay was superb.  Cynthia was available for my pre-trip texts and questions and proactive in her communication throughout our entire stay.   When we arrived I noticed how spotless the apartment was and how the photos on Airbnb don't do the space justice!  The only thing that is accurate is the height of the ceilings but that did not matter to us as we are short.

Cynthia provided everything we needed in general (towels, extra linens, random toiletries, 2 beers in the fridge, etc.) and went above and beyond with the kid stuff (pack n' play, changing table, extra bedding, diaper pail, etc.)  She was thoughtful enough to hand over three local publications geared towards families which were in addition to a large assortment of travel magazines and ""best of"" Portland and greater Oregon brochures.  Most helpful was her list of favorites; we have to agree on the following:  Barista (coffee), Salt and Straw (ice cream), Serrato (Italian), Bridgeport BrewPub (BEER!), Laughing Planet (healthy lunch), PDX Playdate (kids indoor play gym) and Ken's (French bakery).  Soooo spot-on in terms of her descriptions so our expectations were exceeded every time!

Public transportation couldn't have been easier - even with a stroller, four carry-on bags and one big roller bag getting around was a snap.  We traveled to the Portland Children's Museum, various spots downtown, to and from the airport, etc.  Trader Joe's is very close and saved us, yet I have a hunch that had we asked to have something in the fridge or pantry upon our arrival the item would have been there without a fuss.

The beds were comfy, all appliances worked well (incl laundry), and Cynthia has done a great job with incorporating enough decor to make it interesting without running over into that territory of ""everything we don't use anymore let's throw in the rental.""  A cluttered mess this is not, as it has clean lines and is laid out logically.

Overall, I hope you understand how overwhelming it can be when traveling in general, never mind with two children, and how lovely it was to feel ""at home"" with Cynthia's Apt in the Center of NW.  The neighborhood was safe and it was nice to have PBS and other kid-friendly channels all lined up on her Netflix and Roku accounts!  The noise level was about twice a day for about 15 minutes each time, nothing we aren't used to and nothing out of the ordinary.  Also, those were the transition times of getting kids up and out, and putting them to bed.  It was actually nice to know that other families are in that rhythm, too :)

It's truly right in the middle of the city and I had such an easy time navigating.  

The photos are accurate. What you see is all that you get. Nothing more, nothing less. It's a studio with a separating bathroom that kind of gives it a bigger feel. The listing says it comfortably sleeps 4--which it can--but I personally wouldn't stay with more than two due to the spacing.

Cons: It's noisy! Especially on the weekends (the bar across the street had an outdoor band), but even on a Sunday night, there was plenty of action. The walls are thin, so you can hear anything going on on the street. 

The other drawback, for our group of 3, is that the living room with the fold out couch doesn't have a door - you come up a long set up stairs to a landing, and the landing is connected to the living room. This would be okay, except there are other doors off the landing, so it feels very exposed, even though it's around a corner from the top of the landing.

The Garden Studio and the outdoor spaces were simply charming. Sometimes I felt as if we were in a treehouse.  It is a wonderful space.  Hummingbirds were busy just outside the picture window and the backyard was a sanctuary for songbirds.  The location of the cottage is key if you like being surrounded by parks and great restaurants.  We particularly enjoyed Gino's.  Inside the cottage, you will want for absolutely nothing except maybe a TV.  Everything from washing machine liquid to cozy comforters were available.  We were surprised by the privacy and quietness in such a dense neighborhood.  It was very pleasant.  All the linens were comfortable and soft. The kitchen was well-equipped and we figured out how to use new equipment.  The larder was stocked with basics - oils, vinegars, spices - and a few refrigerated items. This studio is best for those who do not mind climbing up to a loft to sleep.  It is not for those who may need to use the bathroom throughout the night and are wobbly on stairs - although the stairs are very user friendly.  There is also a futon that can be used for sleeping on the ground floor.

Felt more  like staying in a hotel sans TV than a typical Airbnb experience, which worked out wonderfully for me. Keyless entry was a breeze, and eliminated the need to coordinate check-in/out with Emma. I especially loved this b/c my schedule didn't need to be set. The location wa super convenient. There are trendy coffee shops, bars, and restaurants in every direction, and of course, Trader Joe's being across the street was super convenient. I stocked up on snacks for the drive back to Seattle.

There are a few notes that I'd like to pass along for future guests to keep in mind that were a bit of a surprise. These did not negatively impact my stay or rating, but it would have been nice to know beforehand.
- Parking is no longer free, and can be a bit of challenge because the neighborhood is quite popular. However, I seemed to always find a space within 3 blocks of apartment any time I needed to re-park. Meters are enforced Mon-Sat 9am-7pm ($1.60/hr as of Nov 2017), and can be paid for 4hrs at a time with CC. (e.g. I paid the meter on Sat right at 9am in my PJs, then went back to bed for an hour. Got back up. Went to brunch nearby before having to pay the meter again.)
- Kitchen is actually just a hotplate, fridge, microwave, dishwasher, sink, and largish mini-fridge. This was totally fine for me, since I rarely cook when visiting Portland because most meals are eaten out with friends or family. 
- Shower/tub area has a lower ceiling than the rest of the apartment, so the shower head is low as well. This is only noticeable if you're on the taller side of the spectrum. I'm 5'9"" and fit in the tub to take a shower just fine. I did need bend to get my head under the shower head when washing my face and hair. For those with long hair, it would also be good to note that the water pressure isn't amazing.",beauti clean space perfect land weekend felt like stay hotel san typic airbnb experi work wonder keyless entri breez elimin need coordin checkinout emma especi love schedul didnt need locat super conveni trendi coffe shop bar restaur everi direct cours trader joe across street super conveni stock snack drive back seattlether note like pass along futur guest keep mind surpris neg impact stay rate would nice know beforehand park longer free challeng neighborhood quit popular howev seem alway find space within block apart time need repark meter enforc monsat ampm paid time paid meter right went back hour back went brunch nearbi meter kitchen actual hotplat fridg microwav dishwash sink largish minifridg total fine sinc rare cook visit portland meal eaten friend famili showertub area lower ceil rest apart shower head well notic your taller side spectrum take shower fine need bend head shower head wash face hair long hair would also good note water pressur isnt amaz,0.35276497695852527,0.5772273425499234,1902,beautiful clean space perfect landing weekend felt like staying hotel sans typical airbnb experience worked wonderfully keyless entry breeze eliminated need coordinate checkinout emma especially loved schedule didnt need location super convenient trendy coffee shops bars restaurants every direction course trader joes across street super convenient stocked snacks drive back seattlethere notes like pass along future guests keep mind surprise negatively impact stay rating would nice know beforehand parking longer free challenge neighborhood quite popular however seemed always find space within blocks apartment time needed repark meters enforced monsat ampm paid time paid meter right went back hour back went brunch nearby meter kitchen actually hotplate fridge microwave dishwasher sink largish minifridge totally fine since rarely cook visiting portland meals eaten friends family showertub area lower ceiling rest apartment shower head well noticeable youre taller side spectrum take shower fine need bend head shower head washing face hair long hair would also good note water pressure isnt amazing

962,4017,114086,8302577,2013-10-24,9173678,Lance,"Much of this was outside of Teresa’s control, but some of it was preventable. To her credit, she made everything right and was very gracious in a difficult scenario. Even so, I would want to know so here goes:

To begin with, I was told the host would not be there and to just let myself in. The front door is always unlocked. My room would be just past the kitchen. I felt uncomfortable with this, but figured that’s just how thing roll in Portland.   I got there at 10p and the house was pitch dark. I’m pretty sure I had the right house, but it’s a little creepy just walking into someone’s house at 10p at night.

After I went into the house, I saw a light on in the room that was supposedly mine.  I could not get a hold of the host.

Then, a guy came out of the bedroom.  I come to find out he’s an over-staying guest and he’ll get his stuff out.  He made multiple trips in and out of the bedroom with garbage bagfuls of stuff.

After awhile, Teresa showed up.  So, I went out to the car to get my things. With zero parking around there, I parked a block and half down around the corner.  While I was getting my stuff, Teresa’s over-staying guest left, but we assumed he’d be right back.

I’m all for chit-chatting, but after 11p and a 3 ½ drive, I just wanted to go to bed. Teresa and I were waiting for the guest to return. “Where is he?” ""Is he coming back?” etc. Teresa called him on the phone. He said he’s left and to just throw away all his stuff which included laptop, Nike shoes, clothes

So, Teresa gets all of his crap out of the room and then discovers the bed is wet. At this point, I’m so done with this place. Teresa puts a towel down on the mattress and we all hope it’s water and not some bodily fluid. She makes the bed, but uses the same comforter from our overstaying guest.

It’s now well after midnight, I just want to go to sleep. There are ants on the desk, cobwebs in the corners and a huge spider parked on the ceiling right over my head. 

But wait, it gets better. At 3:30a in the morning , I heard someone come through the front door with boots on. Our mystery guest clomps to the bathroom across from my room and then proceeded to take a shower. Was it one of the other guests in the house, our over-staying guest, or just a local transient? Who knows? Then, our clomper got out of the shower, heated something in the microwave and left. 

The topper, I got into the shower and the whole shower was rimmed with the half-used hair products of previous guests. I should have taken a picture.",much outsid teresa control prevent credit made everyth right graciou difficult scenario even would want know goesto begin told host would front door alway unlock room would past kitchen felt uncomfort figur that thing roll portland hous pitch dark pretti sure right hous littl creepi walk someon hous nightaft went hous light room supposedli mine could hold hostthen came bedroom come find overstay guest hell stuff made multipl trip bedroom garbag bag stuffaft awhil teresa show went thing zero park around park block half around corner get stuff teresa overstay guest left assum right backim chitchat drive want teresa wait guest return come back teresa call phone said left throw away stuff includ laptop nike shoe clothesso teresa get crap room discov point done place teresa put towel mattress hope water bodili fluid make use comfort overstay guestit well midnight want sleep ant desk cobweb corner huge spider park ceil right head wait get better morn heard someon come front door boot mysteri guest clomp bathroom across room proceed take shower guest hous overstay guest local transient know clomper shower heat someth microwav left topper shower whole shower rim halfus hair product previou guest taken pictur,0.0009975749559082926,0.3900793650793652,2543,much outside teresas control preventable credit made everything right gracious difficult scenario even would want know goesto begin told host would front door always unlocked room would past kitchen felt uncomfortable figured thats thing roll portland house pitch dark pretty sure right house little creepy walking someones house nightafter went house light room supposedly mine could hold hostthen came bedroom come find overstaying guest hell stuff made multiple trips bedroom garbage bagfuls stuffafter awhile teresa showed went things zero parking around parked block half around corner getting stuff teresas overstaying guest left assumed right backim chitchatting drive wanted teresa waiting guest return coming back teresa called phone said left throw away stuff included laptop nike shoes clothesso teresa gets crap room discovers point done place teresa puts towel mattress hope water bodily fluid makes uses comforter overstaying guestits well midnight want sleep ants desk cobwebs corners huge spider parked ceiling right head wait gets better morning heard someone come front door boots mystery guest clomps bathroom across room proceeded take shower guests house overstaying guest local transient knows clomper shower heated something microwave left topper shower whole shower rimmed halfused hair products previous guests taken picture

The room itself was a perfect size, had a small wooden unit with hangers and shelves for clothing, a desk and two windows to let in light. On the desk I was very pleased to find the local bus schedules as well as magazines that highlighted local events, restaurants and activities.

It started with warm cookies and happy greetings. The ""room"" (more like a studio without a kitchen, but there is a microwave and fridge!) was great!! They supplied us with towels, blow dryer, beer, popcorn, and good coffee (not that instant crap). They were more than helpful when it came to finding great places to check out around Portland. Need suggestions for food or attractions, get your pen and pad ready Rhonda has a great list for you, no matter what your likings are.

 The location is out of the way, if you plan on taking public transportation, this is probably not the best location for you, but if you have a car it's no problem, and I highly suggest getting a car to get around Portland, unless you have your bike. 

Most renters want a place where they can see as little of the host as possible, but with these two you'll want to grab a glass of wine and sit out on the deck with them all night. We hope to return very soon and will definitely be staying with them again!

The rooms were spacious and beautiful, with adjustable lighting fixtures and skylights everywhere; Craftsman wood details and design, with restful colors. Comfortable and tasteful furnishings throughout: a dining nook; a sunroom stocked with local magazines of things to do; a writing desk; a big, comfy bed; hundreds of DVDs and an HDTV to watch them on; plus a beautiful, private outdoor sitting porch.

The owners provided everything a vacationer or traveler could want: a new washer and dryer; an ironing board and iron; a gas stove and microwave; a huge refrigerator and freezer; cooking utensils and dishes. They thought of the smallest details.

The setting was wonderful, too: a quiet side street near a bustling little village to suit every shopping need, from food markets to hardware store to antique shops. Even a couple bicycles to use for exploiting!

It will be hard for any other place on Airbnb to measure up to all the quality, comfort, and convenience this studio has to offer.

We hope we can come back and visit again soon!

The room is as described.

Note that although the room is upstairs and private, there is no door. I was a female traveler and always felt safe with Roland and his roommate David though. The bathroom has a tub only so plan accordingly. Fresh towels were provided.

We had to use the fan on her and the rest of us were super hot. There were also a decent amount of spiders because of the gardens outside and the window had been left open. Other than that the place was very clean and comfortable.

This is a beautiful and spacious house, with a great outdoor space for relaxing (& I'm sure the hot tub would be nice in better weather). Rob was a responsive (by text or email) and gracious host, and left a bottle of wine & a chocolate bar on the table to welcome us. His 6 year old son's room also had toys & was a hit with my own 6 year old. (Generally speaking the house is quite clean, modern & open though, which makes a nice departure from our own house/mass of toys.)

The neighborhood is quirky (they don't have a show called Portlandia for nothing!) but still has lots of good places to pick up food (loved Red Sauce Pizza and Pok Pok Noi) or go out (though we tended to go to other neighborhoods, for which we enjoyed Tapalaya for fun Cajun brunch, and Toro Bravo for Tapas dinner), for which Rob left a book with some suggestions as well as house instructions. The bakery at the end of the street, Delphina, is nice for a quick/easy breakfast, but it's worth it to go a few blocks further to go to Miss Zumstein's bakery, which had more savory options & also made what my mother deemed her favorite birthday cake yet (saying something as she turned 81!).

Toilet not suitable for large people, it did fine for us.

Ample street paring.

Basement with Windows, not dark, and lights put in by Elie are very practical.

1305,203073,12508461,137152128,2017-03-13,46420435,Mirene,"Melissa and her place were just the best. It was our first trip to Portland and we had no idea where to stay. We were incredibly lucky to find Melissa's place available and affordable considering the super high hotel prices in the downtown area, which we were initially looking at when we were trying to figure out our weekend housing situation. We weren't sure of the location of the place in relation to the airport or downtown area at first but we were pleasantly surprised to find that it was literally a (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) minute drive away from mostly everything we wanted to do or see. Because of the weather, we weren't able to get any hikes in, but if Multnomah Falls is on your itinerary, it's about a 45 minute drive away according to (Hidden by Airbnb) maps. 

Melissa was super helpful with all of her suggestions for our rainy weekend. She was responsive and made checking in and out super easy- always an A+ for keyless entry. She is also really thoughtful with all of the things she provides in the space for guest use. 

The photos provided are accurate depictions of the space, which is one of the cleanest places I have stayed outside of my own home. I'm one of those weirdos who brings her own sheets and towels to use in hotel rooms and I did not feel the need to change out the sheets at Melissa's. The bathroom was pretty immaculate as well. I absolutely loved the large stand-alone shower as opposed to one with a tub. There were plenty of clean towels and a blow dryer and hair straightener under the sink. This place has pretty much everything you could possibly need- pots and pans, Kleenex, iron, full size refrigerator, cool a-track astronaut helmet boombox, even a washer and dryer in the unit. 

There is a heater/air conditioner in the bedroom that kept the space warm and cozy at night. If you want to heat the bathroom area, just keep the bedroom door open.

1321,269394,18576618,259832521,2018-05-02,11706137,Samantha,"Where to start with this amazing little haus that has everything you need right in the heart of SE Portland (Hawthorne-Division). The Place: ""It's the little things that make the difference."" This house is set on a tree-lined street where there is equal parts privacy, natural light and GORGEOUS natural landscaping (seriously, most peoples front porches rivalled the flora at the praised Japanese Gardens) Everything in Zen Haus, from the layout to decor, had functionality, utility and added to the aesthetic. The little things that you don’t think of really stood out here (did I mention everything is brand new). The towel warmer was probably my partner’s favourite piece which we are already missing post-Portland. Bathroom skylight, double doored mirrors with lots of closet space, washer/dryer combo, outstandingly comfortable bed/duvet and easy to use temperature controls which allow you to make it toasty on a rainy day within seconds. We caught a late flight getting into PDX but the haus has a keyless entry which made it extremely convenient to get in/out whenever we needed and prevented us from having to worry about carrying keys with us throughout our day travels. It was also very helpful for when my partner and I needed to return at different times, ie. he needed a a breakfast sandwich (""Fried Egg, I'm in Love"") and I wanted a bowl from Harlow. The Host: “ Don’t even think about laundering the linens - you are on vacation!” Mary has not only built an amazing haus but she checked in just the perfect amount to see if there was anything we needed during our stay - this was in addition to well thought out document she leaves highlighting all the best sports within a 15 minute walk. We had a late flight out and were worried about lugging our bags around the city on our last day, given that there wasn’t a back-to-back booking she was more than accommodating and allowed us stay in the space until our evening flight. Atop all this, she wanted to check in at the end of our stay and ensure we didn’t strip the bed and wash the sheets as we were on vacation. All in all we felt perfectly comfortable to reach out if we had any questions about the place or area - she made herself very accessible and was super accommodating with our requests. The Neighbourhood: “SE Portland is the heart of Portland” During our stay we tried to check out as many neighbourhoods as we could but our gut was right, SE is the perfect balance between electric shop streets, good eats (even better drinks) and iconic landmarks. There is a Biketown stop less than 2 minutes away, and with easy access to Hawthorne, you can get into downtown/Pearl on transit within 20 on bus/bike. Hawthorne/Divison/Belmont were really the highlights of our trip; Zen Haus is perfectly located amongst the three - you won’t be pressed to find some delicious beer/coffee/food right next door.

We booked his place last minute and Jov made sure we had all of the information / direction needed to get settled into his place nicely. Jov has really made the apartment he shares with his roomie quite comfortable and inviting. Towels were laid out for us and he has an awesome deck and backyard to enjoy a fire and hang out. He actually lit a fire for us in the backyard which was great! 

Really easy to hop on the bus and head to another neighborhood for a drink or some great food. Lots of construction going on next door and underneath their apartment as developers are moving in to the neighborhood so don't expect to sleep too late. Parking was available on the street; however, Jov offered his driveway for our car which was nice.

It did not bother anyone in our group.  We only saw Kevin once, but he seemed super cool and so did the staff down stairs.

Lots of restaurants and bars. We went to Columbia river gorge the next day and it only took about 30 minutes. Taking an Uber from the Airbnb to downtown Portland was less than 10 minutes. The actual room was cozy....perfect amount of space for a couple not wanting to spend much time there besides sleeping and showering. The actual area was very cute and great to walk around.

The shower only had lukewarm water also... For the price we paid, I expected more. Also the sofa bed was rather uncomfortable to sleep in for a few nights.

I basically drove my car to Anjali's and then didn't  get back in it again until I left.  But what was also amazing about Anjali's place was that the moment you walked through the door of The Mississippi Fun District Home,  you entered your own creative space and safe haven.  The house felt inspired, and in turn inspired me to write and create.  It was also clean, comfortable, private, and I slept phenomenally there.  Also, Anjali couldn't have been a better host. She was inviting, and helpful, and so respectful.  Honestly, just go. You will have SO MUCH FUN in that neighborhood and you will feel like you can just walk home to your own oasis in the city.

The location is excellent. All you need is at a glance: supermarket: (WholeFoods), restaurants, bars, ice cream parlour, pubs, cinema and even a cute yoga intimate place.

Public transportation is around the corner. Downtown max. 20 min away by bus (straight).

The pets are treasures. And the chickens ... really cute and they make very tasty eggs. 

This is not just a modern house, it's a home. Our room was spacious, fully furnished (even with a walk in closet) and in spite of being located at the basement, it has a lot of light.
The neighbourhood is very quiet. 

We highly recommend this place and we will definitely return.

The place
- room is the size of a small studio apt (king bed + small sofa)
- has all the amenities that come standard in a hotel room + jacuzzi tub
- he has an 8 month old labradoodle (no fur, doesn't bark, likes belly rubs)
- very clean

Neighborhood:
- quiet and walkable
- lots of restaurants ($ to $$$)

Getting around 
- if you're flying in, you can take the red train line (for $2.50!) straight to the convention center stop; Dylan's place is a mile away (cheaper Lyft ride)
- you can rent commuter bikes at the Nike outlet 2 blocks away for $12 for 24 hours; this is a fun way to see the area and downtown; lots of places to lock up the bike (just be sure to read all the instructions so you don't get fees!)
- if you rent a car, there's street parking

The main floor has a big dining table that fit us all, a comfy living room space and a large kitchen with room to cook and hang out as well as a mudroom and pocket office. The kitchen leads out to the backyard patio, the patio is great and there is a large outdoor dining area too. The backyard is pretty much all gravel. 

All the bedrooms are upstairs. There is one shared bathroom and one bathroom in one of the rooms. There are 3 regular adult bedrooms. In our group each couple took one. At least 2 of them were large enough to set up a pack and play or have another mattress for a kiddo. The 4th bedroom is down a couple of fun steps with a slide! There is a queen bed and room for another mattress. We set up the kids in here and could have had 3 kids in there if they had all cooperated. As it was 2 slept with their parents. 

There is a nice front porch to sit on. The basement had additional rec. space. Everything is comfortable and the AC worked great. 

The house is close to a park with a great play area. We walked to Whole Foods, a tasty coffee shop, a cool bar and my favorite Cuban restaurant in Portland. It is on a quiet tree lined street with lots of families. Easy access to 84th and to downtown via Burnside. 

This is definitely a lived in family home, but things were really nicely put away. There were plenty of bowls and utensils and cookware for us to make a big family meal. There could have been a bit more clarity as to space we should use in the fridge to keep it separate from the household food. At the time of our visit, the host had some house projects going on. It in no way affected our use of the place, but visitors should expect to be staying at a home and not a pure vacation rental. 

Louise was great at communicating and got back to me really quickly. She helped us figure out initially if the house would work for us and then was available for questions along the way. 

Thanks for the wonderful wedding holiday with old friends. We couldn’t have made it work without you.

This AirBnB is a boarding house and you'll share the kitchen with several other guests.

Luckily, the other guests made minimal noise, but we still heard people banging around on the other side of the wall when we were trying to sleep in. 

The host lists his AirBnB as a Bed & Breakfast (as hosts, you can describe the ""type"" of property you are advertising), but when I asked our host about this, he said it was definitely not a B&B. I'm not sure he's changed his listing yet, but this is something future guests should know, besides that Room 7 is off the kitchen.

Her amenities both in the room and the common areas accommodated our every need. She supplied the room with ample blankets and pillows for the cool weather and a surplus of towels, providing a very comforting experience! She brewed coffee every morning to help jump-start our day (tea and other drinks were also available)! She provided curated travel and eating suggestions based on the areas we planned to visit that day. The house location is very accessible; it is walking distance to a lot of great restaurants/bars and very close to the train for getting around the area. 

On top of her outstanding hospitality, Val's home style exceeded our expectations. Her interior design creates a very relaxing, welcoming, comforting, and safe vibe.  She has a very great attention to detail and the decor has an earthy color scheme that creates a natural home-like ambiance. To top it off, she keeps the house VERY clean.

We had a great experience here! I would definitely stay here again and I would highly recommend it to anyone. Val puts a lot of effort and heart into being a host and I know she will make you feel right at home both in the house and in the city.

She and her husband Michael are welcoming, friendly hosts who have fruit, coffee, and delicious homemade muffins available for breakfast. There were fresh bath towels and a bottle of tasty Oregon water waiting for us in our room when we got there. The only thing I didn't like about the room was having trouble falling back asleep around 9am-11am due to the shutters letting in some light.

The upstairs bathroom (right next to the room) has both a shower and a separate, very large bathtub that could comfortably fit two people. The downstairs bathroom has a one person bathtub, but no shower. The upstairs bathroom had quality natural shampoo, conditioner, and body soap gel in the shower available for use. I assume the downstairs bathtub had the same.

Jill had some good advice on places to visit when I asked and left us alone during our stay. We went into the kitchen to chat with her a couple times and she's very nice to talk to. There were clear, concise, and entirely reasonable home rules laid out on paper, and the keys were ready under the doormat (our room had its own key) upon our arrival since Jill and Michael were on their way back from vacation and had their friend Jeff housesitting for them.

I spent my first day simply walking the streets, admiring the old homes, the rose gardens, the trees. Even after venturing deeper in to Portland later in the trip, Ladd's Addition remained the best, most interesting walking space (although I recommend hiking the parks surrounding Portland as well!).

Kym and Fred are kind, welcoming, and thoroughly interesting - the kind of people you want to talk with even after you're too tired from the jet lag to keep talking. :) We got to know each other over the Grimm finale (a supernatural TV show they introduced me to), chatting during the commercial breaks, and afterward about everything from gardening to religion.

This is a residential area so it's a quiet place to rest. The place is also very clean and orderly -- for an OC person like myself, this is BIG PLUS! There's free coffee ( I LOVED THE COFFEE!), basic toiletries and even free beers! Wifi is pretty fast so it was really nice especially since I needed to work at night.

Restaurants are in another part of town so if you're coming in late, try to get dinner somewhere else or just order food which is what we did. 

Danielle is very responsive and accommodating and she answered all our questions on how to get around town and even helped carry my mom's heavy luggage!! She's a superwoman!

The location was perfect, we were able to walk 1 block to everything in the NW District, and it was a quick Uber ride to the Pearl and Downtown.  It was very clean and the bed was comfy, and there was a surplus of towels in the bathroom.  We didn't even realize that there was an extra water closet with a mirror when we booked, which was awesome because we had 2 bathrooms to get ready in.  The height description is real, not an issue for us at all, but if you are over 5'10' you will have to duck all over the place.  Cynthia was super responsive and friendly and gave us some great recommendations of places to see and where to eat.

We did not know that AC is not a thing in the Pacific Northwest, but even in 100 degree weather, this place stayed cool because it was a garden unit, mostly below ground.  There were also 2 fans (one giant one!) that could be moved around the place.  I was a bit surprised by the amount of traffic on the streets at night, but it's a busy trendy area, so it wasn't a concern, just something I wasn't expecting.  If the windows were closed during the night, we would not have heard the trucks and people outside, but it was hot, so we had to keep them open.

While we only saw them spurts at a time (because of our pact schedule in Portland), each time we did see each other - they checked in with us to see how we were doing, asked about our day, and got to know each other a bit! If we had more time in the area, I would have loved to get to know these two better! Definitely warm and kind folks ^_^ 
They also recommended us to eat at this adorable breakfast place called Toast, which my friend and I absolutely  loved ! 

Our area of stay was AMAZING. So much room for my friend and I to do things together and separately when we needed to (getting ready, napping, etc). The main bed was incredibly comfortable! It honestly felt like sleeping on a cupcake! The basement was very cool- which was a super plus since it was very warm outside! 

I loved the backyard/courtyard area. Jordan had just installed a little water fountain which had a soothing sound, adding to the already relaxing atmosphere! 

The private entrance was very accessible and easy. My friend and I woke up early for hiking and it felt good knowing we weren't interrupting our hosts! 

There is also a couch in the living room area that pulls into another bed! I slept there one night and it was comfortable as well! Jordan and Courtney had extra pillows and sheets available and ready for that option! 

Jordan and Courtney when above and beyond- there were hangers in the closet for us (which I definitely used!!!) and suitcase benches for us to put our luggage. Another plus was that there was a first aid kit, make up remover, a hair straightener AND a blow dryer in the bathroom! What a plus!!! Even a little bench for us in the restroom for us to use.

I'd never really contemplated that tradeoff before, but I'm glad I experienced it at this place.

The apartment was much as I imagined it, except upstairs. Don't know why I assumed otherwise. I thought we'd have a separate entrance on the bottom floor. I thought wrong. Two beds: one large, one small, both comfortable. A shared bathroom that was free 100% of the time when I needed it to be. A garden with ducks.  Some interesting but not overwhelming kitsch. And a host who likes to hang out but isn't weirdly up in your business. 

Location may not be perfect for accessibility, but it's closer to things than you'd think from a look out there front door. There's a big dog as part of the deal. She wasn't unfriendly: more like indifferent. It's an older house, with what might either be described as Character if you're into that sort if thing, or Wear if you're feeling less charitable. Not run down by any means: just wouldn't be mistaken for modern.

By my standards, though, very relaxing & enjoyable.

The #4 bus (stops on their corner) became a best friend as it transported me to downtown Portland and other points of interest. The MAX yellow line is about 6 blocks away and connects with other lines in the system.

The Fenton neighborhood, where the hosts live, is nice with a few breakfast and lunch restaurants. Dinner/nightlife places are accessible by bus or light rail. Used the MAX system to travel from the airport and it was cumbersome if you've got more than one bag...the taxi to the airport was about $30 with tip.

One night we stayed, we came in from dinner and Ken and Spyder had just sat down to watch a movie....we joined. How cool is that. I asked if they had wine and they just so happened to have white and red available. We had a glass watched some of the movie and passed out.

IF your unfamiliar with the area this location is perfect. Food, movie theaters and downtown all within 5 miles. Just ask these guys where to eat...they put us on to some of the best food we have ever tried period.

2568,226206,14557591,103516900,2016-09-23,32716333,Otessa,"First let me start by saying Elena was really kind and helpful and got back to me so quickly on every question, concern, etc. Her home is also absolutely beautiful and could definitely be a design exhibit. The backyard was so charming and the beds were definitely the most comfortable beds we've slept in in a long while. I think my only feedback, and the main reason I might not be able to stay here again was that I did not feel safe. The house and neighborhood is beautiful but the house is directly across from an open park, one in which a lot of people are doing a lot of unsafe/ rowdy activities at all hours of the night. Both nights there were fights in the very early am hours and lots of yelling. Which of course is NOT Elena's fault at all but there weren't curtains in the house! The only curtains there were covered a small window in front between all the other giant forward facing Windows without curtains, and anyone across the street could see into the very empty home. The other issue with that was that there weren't locks on any of the doors inside so as someone who was already feeling very uneasy not being able to at least lock my bedroom door so I could sleep and feel safe was really upsetting. If you are from a big city and used to having to think about safety and being proactive this is not the place for you. Other than that my only other issue is that if you have an older lap top it probably won't connect to the wifi, phones connected fine so if that's all you need you're good. But there is also no tv in the house so we wanted to be able to watch movies on the laptop and couldn't, as well as I couldn't get work done at the house so I had to cafe hop. All totally fine, just something to note when considering this place: if you really need wifi on your laptop be warned it might not work. Elena has great recommendations for coffee places and beyond tho! Listen to her! It's all true, we went to good coffee and the barber and both were perfect suggestions! I think overall if you have a decent amount of people staying in the house safety will be less of an issue, the place is beautiful, the back yard is soooo cool/gorgeous AND there is a grill, the beds are beyond comfortable, it's in a great part of the city with so much to do near by and Elena is really awesome. Just know what you are looking for and what you are expecting before staying here as it is a very very simple/ minimalist stay. We tried our best to follow the instructions and clean up to the specs required but we didn't use much so it wasn't too hard to meet the requirements I hope.

The space was clean, well appointed, and comfortable, with the home-cooked breakfasts a well-appreciated bonus. The location of the cottage was great, located in a quiet neighborhood that was still convenient for getting to shopping and eating places (my girlfriend and I brought bikes, and found the streets around the neighborhood really easy to navigate on two wheels).

Only word of warning might be that the stairs leading to the upstairs sleeping area are on the steep side, so if you're not comfortable with tall stairs this might not be the best match. But if you're looking for a great place to stay and get a taste of the tiny house style, I highly recommend the south tabor cottage. I'll certainly be staying again if I find myself in Portland again!

The bed was so comfortable I want to buy a mattress like it. The apt. has a very efficient layout but feels spacious. The bedroom closet gave us an organized space to stow our stuff.  Honestly, with the washer/dryer access,  and the amenities in the kitchen and bathroom, travelers need to bring next to nothing. 

Within a short walk toward 13th St. are nice shops and many places to eat. We had GF pizza at Opa (on 13th), bbq at Reverend’s (on 13th), GF seafood/fish at Corbett’s 100% GF restaurant (on Corbett), a wonderful breakfast at Bertie Lou’s (can’t recall street but it’s close; worth any wait), and amazing brunch at Batter, Griddle, and Drinkery (more of a drive but stellar food, both GF and not; well worth a wait).  No matter when we returned, there was parking out front. The landscaping on the property and at most neighbors’ makes walking the neighborhood a nice evening activity.

The photos accurately represent the apt. (Be advised there are 15ish steps up to the entry of the second-floor unit.)  Highly recommend!

The loft room we stayed in was a really comfy and fun space, and very spacious. Her house is full of interesting artwork and quirky items, and her overall decor radiates personality and has a great vibe. I found myself randomly noticing objects that caught my attention every time I walked through.

Additionally, she was also extremely patient with us when we created a mess at her house that was very inconvenient to clean up. I think just about any other host would have been irritated with us, but she made us both feel at ease about it, which was extremely kind of her. Pamela went above and beyond in just about every respect, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again at her home again the next time I visit Portland.

The listing said that the main house had 5 bedrooms, had 2.5 bathrooms. There were no photos of the bathrooms, just the bedrooms. We assumed 2 showers but found only 1 shower and 1 claw foot tub. This was inconvenient for our family and we'd recommend adding a shower curtain system to the tub. We also found insufficient amenities. We had to buy extra toilet paper, paper towels and bars of soap. 

In addition to the main house , we rented the cottage in the back for our daughter, her husband and baby. It was very nice and the bathroom has a shower.

The bedrooms and common areas were lovely. We found the kitchen to be cluttered and cramped. The microwave door handle was missing, the broiler and the electric stove top didn't work but luckily there was a gas stove top. 

All in all, we had a wonderful time in Portland. We loved sitting on the front porch and relaxing together. We went on terrific tours and visited the Pendleton factory in Washington and the Lewis and Clark restoration in Astoria.

The Tower is a thoughtfully designed, immaculately presented, quiet and secure self contained property.

The heater was a little hard to work and is accessed through a small vent in the bathroom so the initial check- in was quite cold and took overnight to really warm up the entire place.

I informed him I would arrive around 10p. I got there around 1015 and tried the door code numerous times.  I then wrote him an email before locating his phone number on the listing.  My husband left a voicemail and tried to call a few times before the host finally called back with a completely different door code.  He also informed my husband he didn't know we were arriving so late, and that he is best reached through email (again, I told him what time we planned to arrive and I emailed him before calling).  Upon checkout I tried to reach the host to get the door code again since I didn't write it down at 1030pm, nor did he send it to me via email or message.  He never replied, forcing me to leave the key on the table when you enter the unit rather than in the lock box. For the price this unit is located in a very nice, walkable part of town.

- Tons of space; it was like our own little place! It was just my boyfriend and I but I couldn’t believe it was all ours!! There definitely was plenty of space for more folks (another bed downstairs and inflatable mattress). 
- Easy access to freeways and really close to downtown Portland.
- Personal parking and entrance.
- AC; definitely needed that on this hot weekend! :)
- The place was very clean and organized. 
- Loved the design. The place had lots of windows, bright walls, and a high ceiling, which allowed tons of natural light to brighten up the place during the day.
- Decorations and  little touches to the place made it all the more enjoyable.  
- There is also an information section in a corner of the living room that had a section full of pamphlets with tons of ideas for places to hike, things to eat, and much more! That was a great plus and was very thoughtful :). 

CONS: I only wish we could have stayed longer :(

We kept trying and eventually it opened as we later figured out I entered a different code by accident (unbeknownst to me).

Once we entered, we realized Edward was in fact home but sleeping as we heard someone coughing downstairs. 

Later in the night, we came back again and couldn’t open the door again. We texted, called, emailed and knocked for literally an hour and a half UNTIL another guest arrived which had the correct code (edward gave us a code that was 2 numbers off).

My family of 5 (2 adults; 3 kids) arrived about an hour early of check-in and Charissa was more than happy to let us check in. Her rental is the basement of the home but it did not feel like one! It was spacious and we loved her set up. The bedrooms were huge to match the walk/in closets.  Both bathrooms were clean. We loved that there was a washer/dryer in her unit because that definitely came in handy to wash our clothes the night before we left. 

There is the Hawthorne Theater right next door but we were lucky there were no shows so we didn't hear any loud events going on.  

Check out was super easy and no need to turn in keys as the door is powered by a number lock pad. 

We would definitely stay in this rental again if we come back to Portland. =)

Thank you, Charissa, for being a wonderful host and letting us stay in your home.

After 10 minutes of prowling the AirBNB listings for a place in Portland, it became quite clear that this place was “the one.” Kyle and Dao were most gracious in agreeing to host me, this being my first AirBNB experience.

The place is clean, modern, full of nice art, and home to the sweetest cat you’ll ever meet. It is situated less than two blocks from all the necessary public transit stops. The city is super bike friendly, and the hosts have a bike you can rent on the cheap! I stayed a week in Portland, toured just about every hot neighborhood, and only needed a car once (and at this time Kyle and Dao generously offered me a ride).

It would be difficult to overstate how accommodating, welcoming, and warm Kyle and Dao were. I won’t list specifics, as the ways they constantly went above and beyond their responsibilities as hosts would be unreasonable for anyone to expect. They went out of their way on multiple occasions to do things that helped me out, and offered even more favors, invitations, and accommodations than I had time to accept.

These people are healthy, happy, and artistic. They are world class hosts; working class heroes; the salt of the earth.

The space is compact yet so thoughtfully laid out that it feels quite spacious. There is plenty of storage throughout the house, a large closet in the bedroom and plenty of kitchen space which was so nice. The kitchen was well stocked and the appliances brand new. Derek even had a growler in the kitchen which we were able to fill at the amazing grocery store just 2 blocks down called Zupans, which is another reason this rental is so fantastic. It's so conveniently located walking distance to all the great cafes and restos on Belmont. Just a few blocks away in every direction are all the other trendy eateries and boutiques on Hawthorne, Division and Burnside. You couldn't ask for a better location. Derek was extremely responsive from the beginning and even showed me the place before we moved in when I happened to be in town. He was always prompt to answer with any questions we had. Added luxuries of this rental include the most comfortable bed ever, in-house washer/dryer, free cable, fast wifi and a strong & efficient central heating system that kept us cozy in the winter months. I should also note that the neighbors on both sides were extremely quiet so there was little to no noise on most days. The private front deck was a fantastic addition where you can enjoy coffee in the morning or take conference calls as I often did. We simply couldn't have asked for more. My only regret is that we weren't able to stay longer. I would rent this place again in a heart beat.

However, you will be sharing the space with the staff of the Yakuza restaurant. They use the space near the bedroom widow for morning prep, which woke
me up one morning. The staff also have smoke breaks behind the carriage house and keep the gate open to access this area. I didn’t know this was what was going on until I got a knock on the window at night from a staff member I unintentionally locked out. Also, the smoke from their cigarettes tends to waft into the carriage house. The biggest problem with the place is a very noticeable amount of what seems to be sewer gas wafting into the bathroom and bedroom from the shower drain. When I walked into the place I noticed a few fans and lots of air fresheners and an open skylight, presumably to keep this odor down. These didn’t do much.

She was single handedly responsible for making me and my girlfriend's first ever trip to Portland such a special experience. She should be nominated for being among the best among best of Super Hosts. Our original reservation elsewhere was canceled due to water damage and this was a blessing in disguise, as I found Danielle's place. She confirmed my reservation request in a day and asked for key details such as when we were expected to arrive and such. She made ample arrangements so that she could be there when we arrived and she was there to welcome us to her gorgeous house and gave us a tour. Her place is fairly close to downtown Portland and also has the benefit of few restaurants and a convenience store that is within walking distance, which is very convenient. We used Lyft for the most part to get around and it's only about 20 min from the airport and barely 10-15 mins to downtown and other key areas, so having a quiet neighborhood to go back to at the end of the day was great. But that's just the basics. Given it was our first time in Portland, Danielle offered us a ride to Mt. Hood the next morning since she was headed there to ski. We didn't rent a car for the trip and it's about an hour drive away, so we accepted her generous offer. We had brunch at the historic Timberline Lodge while she skied and even enjoyed a drink together later as we marveled at the beautiful view. She took a longer route on the way back just so that she could show us Hood River and the amazing view of the Columbia River on the way back to Portland. She pointed us several key areas such as the waterfalls that we would've not seen or found out about on our own. She's very kind and caring person, this was a day after the tragedy of the hate crime attacks, and we knew we were in great care with us both being Muslims as she picked out flowers from her own place to lay at the mural at Hollywood station. You should feel very safe and welcome at her home no matter your religion, race, sexual preference or identity and she has a sign outside her home stating her support for all groups of people.

That being said the price was too much for what was really offered in the home. The window was partly broken so the air came in which made it really cold and uncomfortable to use. The bathroom also felt like it is being used by someone living in the house with a used razor out. The kitchen was not clean at all with food everywhere. 

I felt like an intruder and did not know if I could use the towel or where I could get any kitchenware. The host never made a point to come in and check in with us to officially go over the rules. She was nice in the end for the five minutes we interacted with her at check out. If it wasn't for the other guy Stefan living there who was so nice to explain things it would have been a worse experience  

Despite having the issues I had it was not a horrible place to stay. The place is in a beautiful neighborhood and you can't get a better location.

Dan was flexible with my check-in time which made my stay easy. His house is wonderfully presented and he is up for great conversation about mountains and skiing if you're an enthusiast. His cats, Doormouse and Ripley, are lovely and if you are a cat person they are friendly and welcoming!

3484,161103,8337813,62116468,2016-02-11,55196291,Shelby Annica,"I stayed here for 7 days.  

Pros: 
separate, semi-private entrance 
security code rather than a physical key 
plenty of yummy food in the neighborhood, all in walking distance 
easy access to bus lines :) the 15 takes you right downtown

Cons: 
Service fee $31
Occupancy Taxes $32
...that's $63 extra dollars, so instead of $34/night, it ends up being $46 a night for 7 days (this is including a flat $20 cleaning fee, which is not unreasonable)
For the price, amount of space, and amount of noise, I would have rather stayed at the hostel. $83 extra on top of the daily rate is a lot for someone lookin for a cheap place. Just a heads up!! 
There were ants in the kitchen.

 I love love love the puppydog, but yelling ""stop barking!"" is actually more harmful than helpful. 
To dogs, yelling is like barking. So the puppy would think she had a barking buddy and keep going and going. It would be a good idea to ask a trainer about that, or do a quick (Hidden by Airbnb) search.

It took us a few minutes to figure out the parking situation, but it really wasn't bad at all. There was usually a spot right in front of the house, but, if there wasn't, parking on the side of the house worked just fine.

The loft itself has spectacular views of the city, with a spacious deck, a table with two chairs and delicious grapes from the grape vines spiraling up the stairs. One note worth mentioning is that the loft is 5 flights of stairs up, and if you have heavy luggage or a lot to lift, just be aware that you will be getting a workout! 

The house is in a great area of the city! The inside is very cozy and homey! It is one big spacious room with a nice kitchen! The bed is tucked away in a triangled corner with a little window looking out onto the street down below, so you can keep an eye on your car. The house is old, so the floors are very creaky with every step, as I imagine most places in the city are. Something else worth mentioning is that there are stairs in the loft leading downstairs to the main house. Though the door is locked and no one can enter, I was definitely able to hear the tenants below if they were near the door, which didn't bother me, but something to be aware of. There are a couple guys who live below the loft, who kept to themselves for the most part, but the one I did meet was very friendly. Donn, the handy man of the house lives in the bottom of the home, he is very sweet and helpful around the house if there are any issues. He had some tomato plants outside that he was happy to share with me. There is also an awesome plum and fig tree on the property! 

All in all, I enjoyed my stay, and enjoyed Tyra too! She has a really great Salon and Spa next door to the house also that I highly recommend treating yourself to! I got my hair cut and colored, as well as one of the best facials of my life there! Her staff is very friendly, and you will leave a happy camper! :) Thanks Tyra!

The fireplace is a great perk as the weather in Portland does fluctuate. It is a basement of a home, so you will hear activity above you- but it didn't bother us as we were out most of the day. We didn't have any interaction with the hosts. The BIKES were probably the highlight of the stay. The neighborhood is about .6 miles to the main area with food/shops etc, so it was nice to have the option to just hop on the bikes. Uber prices can add up! Downtown is about a 10 min uber ride.

Greg’s house is beautiful, in a wonderful neighbourhood with friendly neighbours and a relaxed feel. It’s next to Mississippi and Alberta where we went to eat and wander almost every day. Greg has created lists of places to eat, whatever the meal of the day, and this list was the best! He can also advise you on numerous things around Portland and even helped us book our next hotel!

Greg is unbelievably generous with his guests - offering up so much of his home to us. We had the living room and dining room, bedroom and bathroom to ourselves and felt very spoilt. Everything was clean, comfortable and easy. We had more than we needed. The washing machine was helpful for our long stay and the kitchen was very well equipped. We loved the CDs and we will miss the great bath and big power shower!

Greg is laid-back and leaves you to it if that’s what you want but we also met up and had some good conversations and some laughs. I can see why so many of his guests want to stay in touch. Greg is a genuine, kind-hearted, warm, intelligent and considerate person - not to mention his fascinating and adventurous life! His outlook and way he lives is inspiring. He is one of the good guys! 

This is the best place to stay for so many reasons.

We were welcomed by a bottle of wine and some chocolates! How nice of them! 
The rooms are not too spacy but very cute. I particularly liked the electrical ceramic kettle and even asked where the host purchased it. In fact before our booking, they wrote to us asking if we are ok with the rooms because they might be too small for 4 of us adults. We said yes and it turned out that the rooms were not that small at all, at least we enjoyed it.
The location is great! We booked Roe restaurant in advance, and it's just 10 min by foot. It's actually 10 min away from the Division st, which is the foodie's heaven.

There was an old candy wrapper peeking out from under the couch as well. Overall I felt like the unit was generally a bit dirty. The bed and bathroom were clean which was greatly appreciated. I felt as though the pictures were a little misleading and also that the neighborhood was a little sketchy. Overall, I’ve stayed in a number of Airbnb's across the country and I felt as though this unit was not nearly as clean as others I've stayed in for the same price.

4023,160955,8306520,155678351,2017-05-28,73543610,Amanda,"Aaron and Terie have probably on of the best airbnb places to stay in Portland.  First,  their location.  It's PERFECT right off of Division, just a few minutes from downtown, close to PDX and the interstates. Walking distance to so many great Portland restaurants and literally on the base of Mt. Tabor

Second, their house has amazing taste and flair.  You will flash back to your childhood with the vintage toys, dolls, and ""grandma's house"" look.

Most importantly, wonderfully kind
 family.  Cordial, kind and courteous.

Comfortable queen bed.  Good ambient air temp (a little damp but not at all basement/ musky feeling).  Comfortable and adequate bedding/ sheets.  Good water pressure in the shower (shampoo, conditioner, body wash provided are better than I would buy for myself.. Good stuff) Large bathroom with a moden/contemporary sink and a toilet that could flush a house cat.  Microwave. Coffe pot.  Fridge.  Easy access into the residence with good motion lighting. Private feel, with access being separate from the family's space.  Modern flat screen withand Netflix and such in the bedroom.  

Awesome patio to chill, ear some food, enjoy some peace and serenity serenity that Aaron and Terie have worked to create. 

Definitely recommend staying here if and when you and your family go to Portland.

My partner and I stayed in Fiona's tiny house for 9 days. This was not the room we booked, but Fiona offered it the day before arrival. These switches always make me apprehensive, but I was assured we were ""getting a good deal."" Okay.

During our stay we had a few issues. I will say that Fiona is prompt in attempting to fix whatever issue arose. Here is a list of what went wrong:

Half the outlets were not functional upon arrival
Broken microwave (only way to ""cook"" in the apt) 
Central heating stopped working
Shower temperature was impossible to gauge. Either scalding hot, room temperature, or freezing cold. 
Holes in the wall that were sloppily covered up with picture frames. 

We realize this is a budget room, we know how much we paid. We did not appreciate, however, the accusatory tone that she would bring when asking how these issues arose. Especially when we walked into the majority of these problems.  After checkout she even tried to charge me $80 for a missing “top sheet”! What??

To her credit, she did bring a box of cooking supplies. Such as another broken microwave that wreaked of death and rot inside (I literally gagged), a rice cooker and a George Foreman grill. 

Although I will never be staying here again, if you are on a budget and only in town for a couple days, this could be a good option.

Yet, this “chic and glamorous” offers more than what you see : from quality linens to designer lotions+soaps along with class wall decorations ( of the fine many, at least a couple of prints and one reproduction we would more than  welcome home!…) Fans of only-Ikea, abstain: Caroline’s furniture –not encumbering- is stylish and genuine. The appt is functional and unaffected; not necessarily sparling-knew but complete and operative. Access -ah!, a virtue for the aged-  is effortless. And then comes the location: between 21st and 23rd avenue in tony NorthWest : one is embarrassed by the choice of restaurants, bistros, breweries among a throng of fashionable shops. Less we forget for those fans of Portland’s gem: the Timbers, the stadium IS a leisure-walk from home which is -by-the-way- 60 yds from almighty TraderJoe. Interestingly, amongst all this urban hubbub the quietness –day+nite- in this apt is wondrous & soothing. Yes, parking is not a given but persistency pays (one monition: the daily M parkg passes (good deal $10) that Claudine marshals if requested are valid all round except 21st and 23rd avenues) Instructions for the day-to-day: from trash to phone numbers and general tutelage of the apt are aptly and succinctly posted. OK : a little want for those who may think we are overbuttering it : a small TV for those of us – old timers?- who like NewsHour, Nova and/or Frontline before bedtime it would be convenient. Otherwise WiFi is at speed. We could go on in praise but we should mention that the six days of sunshine ( up to 80F) that Claudine shepherded for us were an absolute non-plus-ultra for an Oregonian April.

The cottage - freestanding, full of wonderful light, views, breezes and gardens - oozes with the charm of an old English home.  The bed was comfortable and the cottage's amenities most appreciated.  I didn't cook while we were there, so I can't speak to those, but the range appeared to be great and the frig and sitting area just right.  Having a designated parking place in Portland is a godsend.  Having a mid or smaller car is a plus.  Because we were traveling with 5 others outside of Portland, we had a large vehicle that required considerable manuevering to park.  Be aware that the next door neighbor does not take kindly to verbal driving directions at 10:15 on a Sunday morning!!  Otherwise, our only disappointment was not realizing the difficult, though relatively short, walk to and from the great areas of 23rd and 21st streets.

Aysha's place in NE Alberta Arts District is the best central hub for a Portland stay.  It is located near all the best restaurants (Pok-Pok, Grain&Gristle, Extracto to name a few).  The area is quiet, but still bustling three blocks away so you have a combination of a wonderful residential feel and a budding area of the city. 

Now on to the accomodations -- Aysha was made for hospitality.  Every square inch of this space is well crafted and focused with the guest in mind.  From the beautiful lighting, to the well stocked kitchen, to the extremely comfortable sleeping space, it all makes coming back for the evening or a break during the day a breath of fresh air. 

Communicating with Aysha and Heidi was easy and they really made my stay seamless.  I had instructions for how to use the items in and near the house, where to rent a bike, how to use the TV, etc.  

If you want a very well hosted experience in an immaculate space, with great people who have an eye for detail, in the best neighborhood in Brooklyn -- stay at Aysha and Heidi's place.

It is a such a beautiful home which has been lived in for many years by the owners, which brings such a feeling of history & nostalgia, to it—that you can feel as though you are walking through ‘ time’!
However, with that being said, the owners have managed to modernize it, as well, at least our most comfortable Airbnb generously ample space with a beautiful view to there lovely garden. (The Bed is very comfortable, mini fridge, & TV!) There is a spacious private bathroom next to your bedroom & a loof like space outside of your bedroom with books and a most ‘comfy’ sofa!

There garden is absolutely heavenly! Lush w/ greenery, trees, flowers, a running cascading waterfall. Table & chairs for eating out.

Virginia & her husband are very kind people & very accommodating.....

This Airbnb is certainly a WINNER!

4196,66696,3104190,86187760,2016-07-15,77141508,Dana,"I rented Amanda's space for my out-of-town guests.  Here's their review:

This was our first Airbnb experience so we had no idea what to expect.  From the get go, Amanda was very accommodating and very warm.  We had a late arrival, so she allowed for easy access to the unit.  She had a concise set of instructions printed out for us which included all of the necessary information about what to expect and what is expected of us.  She had a pantry full of food items if we needed them, offered wifi password, and had a list of suggestions for things to do, see and eat in the area.

The unit was a great space and was comfortable, the bed was great, pillows were nice and plush, everything was just generally warm and inviting.  As I said, the pantry was well stocked, as was the bathroom, and there was plenty of room to stash our suitcases so they were out of the way.

One night we came home and Amanda and Halim were outside.  The greeted us warmly.  They seem like great people.  We really enjoyed talking to them.

A couple of things that are worth mentioning. The owners have dogs, which is generally not a problem as we are dog people.  It is mentioned in the listing, so it was not a surprise that they were there, and the dogs were nice once the owners introduced us to them, but in order to gain access to the unit, we have to go through the gate into the owner’s back yard.  When the dogs are loose, they do what dogs do and protect their property from intruders.  Twice the dogs came charging at us (the first time was when we entered the property from the gate, and the other time was when my son opened the door to leave the unit).  Both times the owners were present and were able to control the dogs, but that initial surprise each time was a bit startling, especially considering they are offering up this place on their property to strangers.

Another thing is that the path from the street around the house to the gate is a bit overgrown.  In the dark, it was a little difficult to navigate, and once you entered the gate, while there was a light around back illuminating the stairs to their deck and the entrance to the unit, along the side of the house, however, it was a bit dark.  Also, there was some pet waste along the path that’s worth noting.

One last item to call attention to is that one day we came back and noticed a moldy type smell and noticed the carpet by the entrance to the unit was a bit moist.  It had rained a bit that day, so I don’t know if water leaked in from under the door to the carpet or not.

All in all, we were very pleased with our experience, and would recommend it to others.",rent amanda space outoftown guest here reviewthi first airbnb experi idea expect amanda accommod warm late arriv allow easi access unit concis instruct print includ necessari inform expect expect pantri full food item need offer wifi password list suggest thing areath unit great space comfort great pillow nice plush everyth gener warm invit said pantri well stock bathroom plenti room stash suitcas wayon night came home amanda halim outsid greet warmli seem like great peopl realli enjoy talk thema coupl thing worth mention owner dog gener problem peopl mention list surpris dog nice owner introduc order gain access unit gate owner back yard dog loos dog protect properti intrud twice dog came charg first time enter properti gate time open door leav unit time owner present abl control dog initi surpris time startl especi consid offer place properti strangersanoth thing path street around hous gate overgrown dark littl difficult navig enter gate light around back illumin stair deck entranc unit along side hous howev dark also wast along path that worth notingon last item call attent came back notic moldi type smell notic carpet entranc unit moist rain dont know water leak door carpet notal pleas experi would recommend other,0.19265634771732332,0.4942901813633521,2647,rented amandas space outoftown guests heres reviewthis first airbnb experience idea expect amanda accommodating warm late arrival allowed easy access unit concise instructions printed included necessary information expect expected pantry full food items needed offered wifi password list suggestions things areathe unit great space comfortable great pillows nice plush everything generally warm inviting said pantry well stocked bathroom plenty room stash suitcases wayone night came home amanda halim outside greeted warmly seem like great people really enjoyed talking thema couple things worth mentioning owners dogs generally problem people mentioned listing surprise dogs nice owners introduced order gain access unit gate owners back yard dogs loose dogs protect property intruders twice dogs came charging first time entered property gate time opened door leave unit times owners present able control dogs initial surprise time startling especially considering offering place property strangersanother thing path street around house gate overgrown dark little difficult navigate entered gate light around back illuminating stairs deck entrance unit along side house however dark also waste along path thats worth notingone last item call attention came back noticed moldy type smell noticed carpet entrance unit moist rained dont know water leaked door carpet notall pleased experience would recommend others

It's a lovely space, very inviting and comfortable. Having grown up in a house of similar age (in Portland, a long time ago), I appreciate the details: the old doors and knobs, tall base trim, the cut out arches between rooms. I loved the hardwood floors, the use of space with drawers and the oven set back into the walls, and the kitchen is fantastic, very well done. What a great house! 

The sleeping arrangements were perfect for us; my children were comfortable on the pull out couch in the living room. 

Anna quickly responded to any questions we had, and very helpfully had the place set up with items for our children (or maybe they're always there, I don't know!): plastic plates and cups, colorful washcloths, some mega blocks to play with. 

The neighborhood is lovely, quiet, residential, but still close and even within longer walking distance (our young children weren't up for it, but very doable) to many shops and restaurants.

There's a cute street with shops and restaurants just about a 15 minute walk away.  We had a car,  and did drive downtown, which, coming from Los Angeles seemed like a breeze.   It's probably not super a expensive Lyft ride  (plus no parking fee that way)  There's a terrific park nearby with a pond and playground, maybe about a 15- 20 min walk, we drove there.  All in all this was a very family friendly area.   My son and I enjoyed a good amount of time in the hammock due to the great weather.   We also made friends with the neighbor cat ,Chester.

The location was perfect for me -- close enough to walk (it took me about 20 minutes), but far enough away that I felt like I had a good distance at the end of the day from all the work. 

Over the course of the week several people/couples were in and out of the second room, and Kate was always good about telling me who would be there. This was really helpful for figuring out whether I'd need to coordinate use of the shared bathroom! 

I really appreciated use of the kitchen. It's a fair walk to any of the shops or restaurants in the neighbourhood, so it was great to be able to have coffee and breakfast before leaving the house. The breakfast nook was perfect for an evening sit-down, and if no one else is using it the table works well as a desk for using the computer or writing postcards. The banana bread was wasted on me, but it smelled great and there was lots of it -- anyone who enjoys fresh baked treats will definitely appreciate it. I did take terrible advantage of the Keurig coffee maker, though. :)

The furnishings inside are eclectic and have a real punch of personality, the kitchen is spacious, and the space in general feels clean, vibrant, and really nice. Tamara's got a great guidebook filled with everything you need to know to work the house and some great neighborhood recommendations. The homeowners can be a little hands-on, however, and for some Airbnb-ers, it can feel slightly micro-managed. There is a lot of responsibility that comes with the home and they are very specific on how to do certain things. This didn't bother us at all, but for some people, it can be a little much to remember, especially since it can feel less like your on vacation and more like you're really in someone else's house.

Her patience and sound advice was so appreciated with my curiosity and excitement on how to best explore this vibrant neighborhood and city. When I arrived, it was a bit of a chilly evening, and Amy had already turned on the heaters and electric blankets. It felt so cozy and welcoming after a long day of travel to a strange city.  When I woke up the next morning, the atmosphere and decor were such a feast for the eyes, and it felt like home immediately. Amy was extremely available as needed, and allowed for space and privacy as well. She is an inspiration and has created the ultimate eden in a place so accessible to incredible restaurants, bus stops and shops. I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to stay in the bus, and I am now dreaming up ideas to do something similar in my town. The experience was so unique, and added such a lovely memory to my bucket list. Something I'll always attribute to my amazing time in Portland. I walked to many incredible places.

(This wouldn't have mattered so much, but we were trying to meet up with a friend and being from Canada, couldn't text or call him). The bathroom door didn't lock. And at the top of the stairs on the other side a cat was meowing whenever we were home without stopping.

-The bed - omg - best bed and bed linens ever! Perfect pillows (with extras in the cupboard.)
-Night stands with lamps on BOTH sides of the bed.
-Adequate hanging space and hangers
-The little basket on nightstand to put jewelry
-Great hot shower with plenty of fluffy towels
-Living room was comfy to hang out in with great WiFi, Netflix and cable for stormy evenings
-I loved the bright, sunny, retro kitchen that had everything we needed.  Good instructions with the coffee maker - a little complicated at first, but makes FRESH GROUND and FRESH BREWED and stayed hot! Thanks for supplying the coffee beans.
-We even did a load of laundry.
We never have a car when visiting Portland.  We arrived at 8 PM and took the red line train from the airport and switched to the 75 bus which dropped us off a block away.  We had a lot of luggage and it was still easy.

4690,239411,15724441,122310204,2016-12-22,101124462,Zenia,"     WOW! If you plan on visiting Portland, please consider booking your AirBnB stay at Brandon's cozy, comfy, cuddly home. I promise you that you will be 100% satisfied with your stay. I honestly have never had a more enjoyable AirBnB experience. 
  
     The kitchen is completely furnished with silverware, plates, and cooking utensils for those of you who are opting to take a break from dining out and wish to cook your own home-cooked meal. The entire kitchen is so immaculate and is also especially convenient for those who wish to heat up their dinner leftovers for breakfast on nice, aesthetically-pleasing ceramic plates. Their bathroom is also spotless as well. Furthermore, they have Netflix for those who wish to relax and spend their downtime, choosing to watch ""Portlandia,"" like me, to further discover ""cool"" places to visit in Portland. And how could I forget- the Knotty Pine room! Can I just say that I almost felt like I was in a cabin when I stayed in this bedroom? It was such an amazing experience to relax and bask amongst a space of wooden panels (literally), as you unwind from a long day. I also liked that we had manual control over the heater/AC for both upstairs and downstairs. Last but not least, it is also helpful to have access to the washer/dryer when you are a total klutz and slipped on dirty ice.. and as a result, have a stain on your clothes.  

     Overall, my stay exceeded my expectations. I am 100% happy that I ended up choosing this place. My Air BnB stay at Brandon's heavenly home partially facilitated in my love for Portland (first-time visit) and have visions of moving to this city in the future. He is so friendly and truly cares about his guests' stay.  I liked that he had laminated sheets of information (ex- wifi password, how to use heater remote, etc) clearly typed out for his guests. 

     I am so pleased with my experience that I plan to book this place again when I visit Portland in the near-future for the 2nd time. Thank you so much for everything, Brandon!!

Rae was very flexible and accommodating with respect to our check-in/departure schedules, which allowed us to do even more than we expected while we were in town.

We especially appreciated the well-written notes and instructions Rae left for us in our room--virtually every detail was accounted for.  The room and bathroom were clean, cozy, and equipped with all of the amenities we needed for our stay.  The property is located in a cute neighborhood across the street from a plaza with an awesome, full-service grocery store, a drug store, and a few small eateries.

Parking wasn’t clear on the description online or when the host emailed me details, and it was actually $10 to park in a lot all day or 2 hour free parking on street but that’s a lil inconvenient. 
And one more small thing, the TV did not work when I first got there and I had to unplug & replug in some things to get it working & then it was really only nextflix that was available. Which I think should be specified, rather than just “TV” under amenities.

4917,187754,11089716,129247929,2017-01-29,84123606,Shawna,"Pros: Great location! Easy to walk to many restaurants and stores. Hayden has a great welcome book that lists local restaurants and how far away they are from the house. The house is wonderfully set up and nicely updated. The beds are extremely comfortable. They all have memory foam toppers.  Parking was never an issue. It is free along the street and we were always able to find parking within a block of the house. There were three separate decks off the house (one off the master, another one of the bedrooms and then one off the living room). It would be perfect for a summer visit when you can sit outside. The house is also set up with a nice Keurig for your morning coffee. Hayden had the shelves stocked with lots of K-cups to choose from. Hayden was always quick to respond and very helpful anytime I contacted him.
Cons: There isn't a lot....more of just stuff to be aware of. Two of the bedrooms were very quiet to sleep in. There is one room which faces the front of the house that is noisier.

We never felt overcrowded.

Additionally, Chrissie and Su add small human touches to make the trip more memorable. To me, this is what Airbnb is all about.

The first thing i noticed upon entering was the VERY STRONG smell of mildew and age. I mean REALLY strong. I did not get used to it after an hour. We found a dehumidifier next to the washing machine, emptied it and turned it on. Also we cracked all the windows and asked the owner for a fan. That did the trick and we slept really well as the mattress and pillows were so comfortable and the temperature was perfect. 

The bathroom situation is a little weird because you have to walk through the laundry area to get to it. That's where the smell in concentrated which makes it an unpleasant journey. Also, the notes online said the owner may be doing a lot of laundry and could come in there at any time, which means you better have all your clothes with you when you take a shower! (We never saw the owner).

The stairs to enter are narrow and steep and have no handrail -- make sure you are not handicapped in any way before renting.

There was a blueberry bush outside that the owner said we could pick and eat from. I had to pull my guy off the fruit a couple of times!! Yummy ;)

The number one most fantastic thing about this place is the location. Walkable (if you don't mind illegally crossing the rail line) to Mississippi Ave. Great architecture in the area.

4994,117598,5406202,35205204,2015-06-16,1700671,Uyen,"Wow,  what an amazing time we had in Portland because of Natalie and her family.  The space is beautifully decorated and as seen in pictures.  It is private and stocked with everything you might need for an overnight stay. Natalie even provided coffee, tea, cereal, and some fruit to munch on. The backyard is peaceful. We loved hanging out in the backyard to read and drink our morning coffee. If you're lucky the family dog will join you as well. As a dog lover, I took advantage of every opportunity to hang out with their incredibly well behaved dog.  The access to a washer and dryer was especially important to us as we stayed for two weeks.  It allowed us to not have to pack as much. The location is perfect...  Head out in any direction,  walk 20 - 30 minutes and find yourself in a great hipster neighborhood. Alberta arts district,  Hawthorne /division,  Pearl District, etc. Lastly, I would say the most important thing about this airbnb home is that Natalie and her family are simply amazing people.  They have a way of making you instantly feel at home. It was like visiting friends we had not seen in a long time. They included us in family activities and helped us find all the best restaurants /sites so our visit to Portland would be exactly what we wanted. Best airbnb experience we have had to date.

The location was fairly central and in a quiet neighborhood of Portland. Jennifer was very welcoming and clearly has put a lot of thought into the details- fresh eggs and roasted coffee, wine and hot cocoa.However, it is a basement and was VERY VERY loud the night we stayed. We could hear conversations and every footstep above. I don't know if there was a dinner party going on or house guests but it was incredibly loud. Perhaps if you didn't plan on a relaxing evening there and went out until 10pm or so it would work fine, it wasn't nearly as loud in the morning. But if you are looking for a quiet spot to retire to early (we had our young son with us and it was far too loud for him to fall asleep- and he is NOT a baby that typically struggles with falling asleep) this is not the spot for you.  Because of that part of our experience we would not choose to stay here again.
